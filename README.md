Small fast library written in avr assembler  
Can be used with standard c/c++ compilers, ARDUINO or pure assembler programming
* for LCD HD44780 compatible (8/4 bit interface)
* for LED MAX7221 driver (not yet implemented)

### planned
* support for serial interface (74HCT164 based with 3 wire interface)
* better support f√ºr AVR port description (maybe include files?)
* more accurate calculation for mswait
